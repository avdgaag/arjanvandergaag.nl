</html>;"èI have decided to start blogging again. You are currently reading my new blog; my old blog is now gone ([not really][4]). It was time for a fresh start.
{: .leader }

My old blog was launched well over five years ago -- rather amazing, come to think of it. It was never very good or exciting, but I enjoyed writing and tinkering with my own website. It got some traffic, some incoming links and some followers among friends and family, but nothing special. I would be lying if I'd say I weren't slightly disappointed. Deep down I was hoping, or maybe _assuming_, I'd someday become an awesome celebrity blogger.

Unconscious disappointment turned into negligence, leaving my blog unattended  for over a year. In the meantime [I have taken up Twitter][1], but I found I sometimes wish I had more than 140 characters. [I missed blogging][5].

## Launching my new blog

I decided to create a new site and get rid of all the distractions of blogging and concentrate on the writing. This site no longer aims to be a _portal of me_, a magazine, _tumble log_ or even a blog -- since that would imply a topic and frequency. This new site has simply become my website, where I occasionally write, if and when I want to.

I've gotten rid of a dynamic CMS[^cms] in favour of publishing static HTML pages -- about which I'll write more soon. I can tell you now that it makes managing my site a hell of a lot easier: there a far fewer moving parts.

## New blog... Really?

I'm not announcing new regular updates. This is just a site with some pages I write. That's all.

Oh, and it's got a feed. [Stay in the loop][2].

</html>;"fCreating and publishing a sitemap XML file helps search engines find and index
all of your content. Most CMS alert Google to come check out your sitemap
file, but here's a Rake task to do it yourself.
{: .leader }

This site is generated using Jekyll, a static website generator. I've got [a
sitemap file set up][1] to include links to all my pages and posts. All I need
now is to tell Google the file has changed -- and do that every time I push
changes to my server.

## Rake to the rescue

I've set up the following Rake task to handle pinging Google for me:

{:.ruby}
    desc 'Notify Google of the new sitemap'
    task :sitemap do
        require 'net/http'
        require 'uri'
        Net::HTTP.get(
            'www.google.com',
            '/webmasters/tools/ping?sitemap=' +
            URI.escape('http://domain.com/sitemap.xml')
        )
      end
    end

Running `rake sitemap` is now enough to let Google know that my sitemap has
changed. I have chained this task in my publication process, so that every
time I run `rake publish` my site will be re-generated and published, and
Google will be notified.

I've also set up a task to ping [ping-o-matic][2]. You see
[my entire `Rakefile` at Github][3].

<h2 id="about-jekyll">About Jekyll</h2>

<p>Jekyll generates static <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages for you. The project‚Äôs author, Tom
Preston-Werner, has written <a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html" title="Read more about Jekyll on Tom Preston-Werner's site">a nice introduction to Jekyll</a>, but it comes
down to this:</p>

<p>Let me stress my point: I can use my favorite text editor and versioning
system for my blog, rather than some wimpy <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>.</p>

<h2 id="here-comes-trouble">Here comes trouble</h2>

<p>Jekyll doesn‚Äôt do a lot, by design. Some manual labour is involved, which is
to be automated ‚Äì because we don‚Äôt like manual labour, now do we? I‚Äôve
written about some of my scripts to enhance Jekyll in separate posts:</p>

<p>I have included all these snippets, and some others, in one big Rakefile in my

all the files to the server and ping Google about my new sitemap.</p>

{: .leader }

## About Jekyll

Jekyll generates static HTML pages for you. The project's author, Tom
Preston-Werner, has written [a nice introduction to Jekyll][1], but it comes
down to this:

- Create some text files that will be your pages and blog posts.
- Create an HTML lay-out file that defines headers and footers for your pages.
- Run Jekyll to combine your text files and lay-out to a website.
- Upload your files to your server for the world to see.

If it sounds easy, that's because it is. I can use [my favourite text editor][3]
and [version control system][4] to write my posts, and then I let Jekyll use
[Markdown][2] to turn my files into HTML. You can also use other filters, or
write plain HTML.

Let me stress my point: I can use my favorite text editor and versioning
system for my blog, rather than some wimpy `<textarea>`.

## Here comes trouble

Jekyll doesn't do a lot, by design. Some manual labour is involved, which is
to be automated -- because we don't like manual labour, now do we? I've
written about some of my scripts to enhance Jekyll in separate posts:

- [Creating new posts][8]
- [Publishing files to a server][9]
- [Ping Google about my updated sitemap][10]

## Publication process

I have included all these snippets, and some others, in one big Rakefile in my
project directory. Whenever I am ready to publish my site to my server I can
simply call `rake publish` and it will let Jekyll re-generate my site, upload
all the files to the server and ping Google about my new sitemap.

The actual [source code to my site is shared publicly at Github][5], so you
can check out [my collection of tasks][6].

## Issues unresolved

First, since my entire website is now just static HTML it is **no longer
possible to have comments** on my site, unless I would use something like
[Disqus][7]. I'm fine without comments. Second, since Jekyll is Ruby gem,
writing more Ruby to add functionality to the website is easy -- but actually
getting it in there is a little harder. **Jekyll lacks a neat plug-in
solution**. Luckily it's easy to fork Jekyll on Github and hack away. Thirdly,
setting up archive pages, searching, RSS syndication, tagging and post
browsing **take some manual labour**, but for now I'm fine without them.
Jekyll is certainly not suited for everyone, but for simple sites it works fine.

## Conclusion

Jekyll makes creating and maintaining websites fun, in a geeky kind of way. I
love the control it gives me. Tom Preston-Werner writes:

<h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
<p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<p><strong>This</strong> Lorem Ipsum HTML example is created from the parts of Placeholder Markup with Lorem Ipsum - Jon Tan, Emastic CSS Framework, Tripoli CSS Framework and Baseline CSS Framework .</p>

                <h1>Introducing Œºtil</h1>
<p class="meta">
    Published at 08-02-2010 &bull;
    Tagged javascript, library, Œºtil, jquery, dom<br>
    Next: <a href="/blog/hello-world.html">Hello, world!</a>
    Previous: <a href="/blog/creating-new-jekyll-posts.html">Creating new Jekyll posts</a>
</p>

<p>Lately in my web development work I find myself needing some simple JavaScript tools. Usually I bring out jQuery, but sometimes it just doesn‚Äôt feel right to load an entire library in order to show and hide some elements.</p>

<p>That is why I recently started developing a tiny JavaScript toolkit of my own, called Œºtil (mu-til). It‚Äôs purpose is to make basic DOM operations a little easier without taking on too much bloat. You can find the [Œºtil at Github][].</p>

<h2 id="why-a-new-library">Why a new library?</h2>

<p>There‚Äôs more than enough JavaScript libraries out there, but here‚Äôs why I wrote one:</p>

<ul>
<li>it‚Äôs a great way to learn JavaScript.</li>
  <li>it‚Äôs nice to have a pet project</li>
  <li>I wanted something specific that other libraries did not provide</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs good to really know the tools you use</li>
</ul><p>I‚Äôll still be using bigger frameworks of course, but on some cases Œºtil will suffice and I will enjoy creating a as-lean-as-possible website.</p>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>Œºtil only does a couple of things, all of which I have stolen from the big guys:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple element selection</li>
  <li>Adding event observers</li>

<pre><code class="language-js"><span class="c">// on page load</span>
<span class="pd">$</span>(<span class="kw">function</span>() {

  <span class="c">// Select all links in the content leader</span>
  <span class="pd">$</span>(<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">#content p.leader a</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)

    <span class="c">// observe the click event</span>
    .addEvent(<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">click</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>, <span class="kw">function</span>(e) {

      <span class="c">// stop event propagation and prevent default link behaviour</span>
      e.stop();

      <span class="c">// Set a nice background color on its parent</span>
      <span class="pd">$</span>(<span class="lv">this</span>.parentNode).setCss({ <span class="ke">background</span>: <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">#ffffe1</span><span class="dl">'</span></span> });
  });
});</code></pre>

<p>And here‚Äôs using the packager from the command line to generate a minified library file of the Œºtil core and some plugins:</p>

<pre><code>$./bin/mutil hover classes
</code></pre>

<p>This will generate a <code>mutil.min.js</code> file that includes the core library and the <code>hover</code> and <code>classes</code> plugins. Easy!</p>

<h2 id="experience">Experience</h2>

<p>Writing a little library is great fun, as you get to explore practical needs, writing documentation, code optimization and crazy JavaScript quirks. I‚Äôve learned a lot from writing Œºtil, and even if I will never use it in a production environment it was time well spent.</p>

Lately in my web development work I find myself needing some simple JavaScript tools. Usually I bring out jQuery, but sometimes it just doesn't feel right to load an entire library in order to show and hide some elements.

That is why I recently started developing a tiny JavaScript toolkit of my own, called Œºtil (mu-til). It's purpose is to make basic DOM operations a little easier without taking on too much bloat. You can find the [Œºtil at Github][].

## Why a new library?

There's more than enough JavaScript libraries out there, but here's why I wrote one:

* it's a great way to learn JavaScript.
* it's nice to have a pet project
* I wanted something specific that other libraries did not provide
* It's good to really know the tools you use

I'll still be using bigger frameworks of course, but on some cases Œºtil will suffice and I will enjoy creating a as-lean-as-possible website.

## Concepts

Œºtil only does a couple of things, all of which I have stolen from the big guys:

* Simple element selection
* Adding event observers
* Working with class names
* Adding various core extensions to String and Array
* Extensions to quickly add features on a per project basis.
* a really simple build script to concatenate and minify the Œºtil core and required plugins.
* a packager, to quickly generate a minified library file to include in a project.

Œºtil doesn't do Ajax or effects. If I need that I'm much better off with jQuery. Most of the features are extensions on the core library, and it's nice and easy to add more.

## Usage

Here's a quick code sample from the project README to show off:

{:.js}
    // on page load
    $(function() {

      // Select all links in the content leader
      $('#content p.leader a')

        // observe the click event
        .addEvent('click', function(e) {

          // stop event propagation and prevent default link behaviour
          e.stop();

          // Set a nice background color on its parent
          $(this.parentNode).setCss({ background: '#ffffe1' });
      });
    });

And here's using the packager from the command line to generate a minified library file of the Œºtil core and some plugins:

    $./bin/mutil hover classes

This will generate a `mutil.min.js` file that includes the core library and the `hover` and `classes` plugins. Easy!

## Experience

Writing a little library is great fun, as you get to explore practical needs, writing documentation, code optimization and crazy JavaScript quirks. I've learned a lot from writing Œºtil, and even if I will never use it in a production environment it was time well spent.

<p class="leader">Jekyll, a static site generator, is <em>blog-aware</em>. That means it tracks posts
and publication dates. Working with such files can be tricky, but here is one
way of using Rake to ease the pain.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-need">What we need</h2>

<p>Jekyll requires blog posts to be saved in files with a specific filename. It
should include the title of the post <strong>and the publication date</strong>. Example:
2009-06-15-hello-world.markdown. The extension tells Jekyll what text filter
to use (Markdown in this case).</p>

<h2 id="what-we-want">What we want</h2>

<p>Manually typing filenames in the form <code>yyyy-mm-dd-title.filter</code> is a
pain. I want to be able to create a post, given a title, and let it figure out
the date itself.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-get">What we get</h2>

<p>I use the following Rake task to create post files:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">desc <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">create a new draft post</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
task <span class="sy">:post</span> <span class="r">do</span>
  title = <span class="co">ENV</span>[<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">TITLE</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>]
  slug = <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span><span class="co">Date</span>.today<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="k">-</span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span>title.downcase.gsub(<span class="rx"><span class="dl">/</span><span class="k">[^</span><span class="ch">\w</span><span class="k">]+</span><span class="dl">/</span></span>, <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">-</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="dl">"</span></span>

  file = <span class="co">File</span>.join(
    <span class="co">File</span>.dirname(<span class="pc">__FILE__</span>),
    <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">_posts</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>,
    slug + <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">.markdown</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
  )

  <span class="co">File</span>.open(file, <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>) <span class="r">do</span> |f|
    f &lt;&lt; <span class="s"><span class="dl">&lt;&lt;-EOS</span></span>.gsub(<span class="rx"><span class="dl">/</span><span class="k">^    </span><span class="dl">/</span></span>, <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)<span class="s"><span class="k">
    ---
    layout: post
    title: </span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span>title<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="k">
    published: false

  <span class="r">end</span>

  system (<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span><span class="co">ENV</span>[<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">EDITOR</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>]<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="k"> </span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span>file<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="dl">"</span></span>)
<span class="r">end</span></code></pre>

<p>Now I can type <code>rake post TITLE='hello, world'</code> to create a post. Here‚Äôs what
it does:</p>

<ol>
<li>At lines 3 and 4 it finds the <code>TITLE</code> argument and converts it to a
suitable filename with the current date prepended.</li>
  <li>At line 6 the filename is expanded to a full path to the file to create.</li>
  <li>The following block (8‚Äì18) writes a post template to that file. This is
some <abbr title="Yet Another Markup Language">YAML</abbr> front matter, with the <code>published</code> flag down by default.</li>
  <li>Finally, at line 20, it launches the file in my default text editor,
which in my case in <a href="http://macromates.com" title="TextMate is my favourite text editor">TextMate</a>.</li>
</ol><h2 id="draft-posts">Draft posts</h2>

<p>With the <code>published</code> flag set to <code>false</code> <strong>I can keep my drafts in my Git
repository without actually publishing them</strong>. I can find all draft posts
using <code>rake drafts</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">desc <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">List all draft posts</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
task <span class="sy">:drafts</span> <span class="r">do</span>
  puts <span class="sh"><span class="dl">`</span><span class="k">find ./_posts -type f -exec grep -H 'published: false' {} </span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">;</span><span class="dl">`</span></span>
<span class="r">end</span></code></pre>

<h2 id="renaming-files">Renaming files</h2>

<p>One slight problem occurs when I want to rename the file to publish it on a
different date. I don‚Äôt have a task yet that can easily rename a file. It
would also be useful to be able to override the default extension.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs still some work to do, but I guess I‚Äôve got 80% of the scenarios
covered.</p>

Jekyll, a static site generator, is *blog-aware*. That means it tracks posts
and publication dates. Working with such files can be tricky, but here is one
way of using Rake to ease the pain.
{: .leader }

## What we need

Jekyll requires blog posts to be saved in files with a specific filename. It
should include the title of the post **and the publication date**. Example:
2009-06-15-hello-world.markdown. The extension tells Jekyll what text filter
to use (Markdown in this case).

## What we want

Manually typing filenames in the form `yyyy-mm-dd-title.filter` is a
pain. I want to be able to create a post, given a title, and let it figure out
the date itself.

## What we get

I use the following Rake task to create post files:

{:.ruby}
    desc 'create a new draft post'
    task :post do
      title = ENV['TITLE']
      slug = "#{Date.today}-#{title.downcase.gsub(/[^\w]+/, '-')}"

      file = File.join(
        File.dirname(__FILE__),
        '_posts',
        slug + '.markdown'
      )

      File.open(file, "w") do |f|
        f << <<-EOS.gsub(/^    /, '')
        ---
        layout: post
        title: #{title}
        published: false
        categories:
        ---

        EOS
      end

      system ("#{ENV['EDITOR']} #{file}")
    end

Now I can type `rake post TITLE='hello, world'` to create a post. Here's what
it does:

1. At lines 3 and 4 it finds the `TITLE` argument and converts it to a
   suitable filename with the current date prepended.
2. At line 6 the filename is expanded to a full path to the file to create.
3. The following block (8‚Äì18) writes a post template to that file. This is
   some YAML front matter, with the `published` flag down by default.
4. Finally, at line 20, it launches the file in my default text editor,
   which in my case in [TextMate][1].

## Draft posts

With the `published` flag set to `false` **I can keep my drafts in my Git
repository without actually publishing them**. I can find all draft posts
using `rake drafts`:

{:.ruby}
    desc 'List all draft posts'
    task :drafts do
      puts `find ./_posts -type f -exec grep -H 'published: false' {} \\;`
    end

## Renaming files

One slight problem occurs when I want to rename the file to publish it on a
different date. I don't have a task yet that can easily rename a file. It
would also be useful to be able to override the default extension.

There's still some work to do, but I guess I've got 80% of the scenarios
covered.

<h2 id="what-we-need">What we need</h2>

<p>Jekyll requires blog posts to be saved in files with a specific filename. It
should include the title of the post <strong>and the publication date</strong>. Example:
2009-06-15-hello-world.markdown. The extension tells Jekyll what text filter
to use (Markdown in this case).</p>

<h2 id="what-we-want">What we want</h2>

<p>Manually typing filenames in the form <code>yyyy-mm-dd-title.filter</code> is a
pain. I want to be able to create a post, given a title, and let it figure out
the date itself.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-get">What we get</h2>

<p>I use the following Rake task to create post files:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">desc <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">create a new draft post</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
task <span class="sy">:post</span> <span class="r">do</span>
  title = <span class="co">ENV</span>[<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">TITLE</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>]
  slug = <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span><span class="co">Date</span>.today<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="k">-</span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span>title.downcase.gsub(<span class="rx"><span class="dl">/</span><span class="k">[^</span><span class="ch">\w</span><span class="k">]+</span><span class="dl">/</span></span>, <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">-</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="dl">"</span></span>

  file = <span class="co">File</span>.join(
    <span class="co">File</span>.dirname(<span class="pc">__FILE__</span>),
    <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">_posts</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>,
    slug + <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">.markdown</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
  )

  <span class="co">File</span>.open(file, <span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="k">w</span><span class="dl">"</span></span>) <span class="r">do</span> |f|
    f &lt;&lt; <span class="s"><span class="dl">&lt;&lt;-EOS</span></span>.gsub(<span class="rx"><span class="dl">/</span><span class="k">^    </span><span class="dl">/</span></span>, <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>)<span class="s"><span class="k">
    ---
    layout: post
    title: </span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span>title<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="k">
    published: false
    categories:
    ---
</span><span class="dl">
    EOS</span></span>
  <span class="r">end</span>

  system (<span class="s"><span class="dl">"</span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span><span class="co">ENV</span>[<span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">EDITOR</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>]<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="k"> </span><span class="il"><span class="idl">#{</span>file<span class="idl">}</span></span><span class="dl">"</span></span>)
<span class="r">end</span></code></pre>

<p>Now I can type <code>rake post TITLE='hello, world'</code> to create a post. Here‚Äôs what
it does:</p>

<ol>
<li>At lines 3 and 4 it finds the <code>TITLE</code> argument and converts it to a
suitable filename with the current date prepended.</li>
  <li>At line 6 the filename is expanded to a full path to the file to create.</li>
  <li>The following block (8‚Äì18) writes a post template to that file. This is
some <abbr title="Yet Another Markup Language">YAML</abbr> front matter, with the <code>published</code> flag down by default.</li>
  <li>Finally, at line 20, it launches the file in my default text editor,
which in my case in <a href="http://macromates.com" title="TextMate is my favourite text editor">TextMate</a>.</li>
</ol><h2 id="draft-posts">Draft posts</h2>

<p>With the <code>published</code> flag set to <code>false</code> <strong>I can keep my drafts in my Git
repository without actually publishing them</strong>. I can find all draft posts
using <code>rake drafts</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">desc <span class="s"><span class="dl">'</span><span class="k">List all draft posts</span><span class="dl">'</span></span>
task <span class="sy">:drafts</span> <span class="r">do</span>
  puts <span class="sh"><span class="dl">`</span><span class="k">find ./_posts -type f -exec grep -H 'published: false' {} </span><span class="ch">\\</span><span class="k">;</span><span class="dl">`</span></span>
<span class="r">end</span></code></pre>

<h2 id="renaming-files">Renaming files</h2>

<p>One slight problem occurs when I want to rename the file to publish it on a
different date. I don‚Äôt have a task yet that can easily rename a file. It
would also be useful to be able to override the default extension.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs still some work to do, but I guess I‚Äôve got 80% of the scenarios
covered.</p>;
