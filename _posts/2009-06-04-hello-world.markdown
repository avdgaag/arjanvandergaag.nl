description: In which I announce the launch of my new website.

I have decided to start blogging again. You are currently reading my new blog; my old blog is now gone ([not really][4]). It was time for a fresh start.
{: .leader }

My old blog was launched well over five years ago -- rather amazing, come to think of it. It was never very good or exciting, but I enjoyed writing and tinkering with my own website. It got some traffic, some incoming links and some followers among friends and family, but nothing special. I would be lying if I'd say I weren't slightly disappointed. Deep down I was hoping, or maybe _assuming_, I'd someday become an awesome celebrity blogger.

Unconscious disappointment turned into negligence, leaving my blog unattended  for over a year. In the meantime [I have taken up Twitter][1], but I found I sometimes wish I had more than 140 characters. [I missed blogging][5].

## Launching my new blog

I decided to create a new site and get rid of all the distractions of blogging and concentrate on the writing. This site no longer aims to be a _portal of me_, a magazine, _tumble log_ or even a blog -- since that would imply a topic and frequency. This new site has simply become my website, where I occasionally write, if and when I want to.

I've gotten rid of a dynamic CMS[^cms] in favour of publishing static HTML pages -- about which I'll write more soon. I can tell you now that it makes managing my site a hell of a lot easier: there a far fewer moving parts.

## New blog... Really?

I'm not announcing new regular updates. This is just a site with some pages I write. That's all.

Oh, and it's got a feed. [Stay in the loop][2].

        I even flirted with Movable Type and TextPattern. None ever really
        satisfied me.
