I make screencasts, or video tutorials. Here’s an overview of what I do and how I do it.
{: .leader }

## My screencasts

I publish my screencasts using [Vimeo][5], all collected in [a single album][6].

## Recording software

I have tried various Windows clients to record screencasts, but ever since I’ve got a Mac I’m in love with <del>Vara software</del> <ins>Telestream</ins>’s [Screenflow][3]. It is a powerful but unbloated tool to record and edit screencasts. I use it for recording my screen and my voice, adding highlights and importing still images. It can also display your keypresses.

## My typical workflow

1. I write a script. This outlines the subject of the screencast and more or
   less the exact words I will use in the recording, together with the
   accompanying tasks.
2. Based on the script I use [Keynote][2] to create title screens and any
other text required in the video. Keynote exports these for me to PNG image
files which I import into Screenflow.
3. I have set up an account on my Mac for screencasting. This account has the
   default OS X setup. Here I set up my demonstration environment, including
   example data.
4. I record my video in one go, sometimes re-recording messy parts. I then
   merge these in screenflow, together with my still images.
5. Since Screenflow records the entire screen I then go through the video and
   zoom in on windows or actions where applicable. I also add highlights where
   necessary to clarify what I’m doing.
6. Screenflow then exports the video for me to a Quicktime movie that is
   easily shared over the web. My videos are typically 5 minutes long and
   weigh in at 20 megabytes.
