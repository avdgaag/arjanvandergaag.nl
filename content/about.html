<p>Arjan is a thirty-something software developer, historian and all-round geek who enjoys developing software and is lucky enough to get paid to do so at Brightin. He tries to be the best person he can be and enjoys helping others do the same. Also, he's happily married, a father-of-two and likes explaining history trivia to his genial dog&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;who, frankly, is the only one who'll&nbsp;listen.</p>
