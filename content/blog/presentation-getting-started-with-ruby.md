I gave a lightning talk about using the ruby program the other day at [Eindhoven.rb][], the Ruby user group for the Eindhoven area.
{: .leader }

Ruby is a programming language, and `ruby` is the program you invoke it with. It takes some interesting arguments that enable you to use it as a general-purpose command line scripting solution -- traditionally the domain of Perl.

In my [slides][] I go over most of the options and some common use cases, so flip through them. Being a lightning talk, there wasn't time to review these features in-depth, but [Programming Ruby 1.9][0] is a great reference book to find out more.

The [slides at Speakerdeck][slides] do not contain any presenter notes, but there is actually a [video recording available][video]. Check it out:
