There is yet another software bundle out for indie Mac OS X applications. This time, it is called the [productivity software bundle][1] and it features eight productivity-related applications.
{: .leader }

I found this bundle [via Shawn Blanc][2], and I was was rather excited at first. There are some notable apps in this bundle, such as [TextExpander][3], [Path Finder][4] and [Mail Act-On][5] — software I have heard a lot about.

## What's in the bundle?

As with all similar bundles, there are big names in there that sell the bundle, and some little guys catching a ride. Here's a full list of what's in there, and my thoughts on it:

[TextExpander][3]
:   Text macros application: type an abbreviation anywhere, and it gets
    expanded to a full snippet of text. A highly-recommended time saver.

[Path Finder][2]
:   Replacement application for the finder, featuring tabs, dual pane
    browser, terminal and more advanced stuff. Some people swear by it, so I
    was keen to give it a try. It's not bad, but I cannot get used to
    using a third-party application as my file browser. Reverted to
    Finder and _uninstalled_.

[Socialite][6]
:   Social media desktop application. Doesn't sound like and isn't a good fit.
    A desktop app is too much overhead for the casual user; it offers too few
    advantages for the 'power user'. _Uninstalled_.

[HoudahSpot][7]
:   I don't get this app. It's spotlight search, but with a cluttered
    interface and an annoying helper app that shoves a big window in your face
    when the mouse cursor touches the edge of the screen. I have no clue why I
    wouldn't use Spotlight proper. _Uninstalled_.

[Today][9]
:   A simple application that displays daily events and tasks from iCal. It's
    a nicely executed idea, but I am not a heavy calendar user so an entire
    application just to display today's events is overkill for me. Besides, if
    I was going to enhance iCal with an external app, I'd go for
    [Fantastical][8] — it just adds a little more value. _Uninstalled_.

[Keyboard Maestro][10]
:   A keyboard macro program, used to control parts of your desktop without
    the mouse. Sounds good, but I haven't really tried it yet. I also don't
    really have a need for it, as I use some handy native OS X shortcuts and
    have set up some other dedicated apps with keyboard shortcuts. Will
    probably never use and _uninstall_ soon.

[Blast][11]
:   A simple application from the same company that makes Socialite, that
    gives you a list of recently used documents. Just like Mac OS X already
    does itself. Solves no problem I am having. Also, I don't really like the
    interface. _Uninstalled_.

[Mail Act-On][5]
:   A plug-in for Mail.app that neatly exposes some handy features for working
    with messages from your keyboard. It does several things, but I use it
    mostly for filing messages — a feature I sorely miss in Mail.app. When
    trying to keep your inbox empty, moving messages to other folders with a
    few simple keystrokes is so much better than drag-and-drop or using Mail's
    own "Move to folder" menu item.

So, I uninstalled most of the apps within a day after first installing them. They're not bad software — I just prefer to use as little software as possible ([Patrick Rhone at minimalmac][12] has lots more to say about that). There is a cost involved with the installation, usage, maintenance and added clutter of using third-party applications. I find only very few applications add enough value to outweigh their costs (let alone their price).

## Bundles are nice, even though you won't use most of it.

I still think bundles like this are a good thing. As a customer, I get some nice software at a discount. The developers get more people trying their app, that otherwise probably wouldn't have paid full-price. If the app is good, there's a good chance you capture some new paying customers for the future.

## To buy or not to buy?

The [Productive Macs bundle][1] is a good purchase. I was just about to pay to full price for TextExpander, which is $32.95 on its own. At $29.99, this bundle is worth buying even if only for TextExpander. Considering you also get Mail Act-On, **this really is a steal** — even if takes some time to install, try and then uninstall all the other apps.
