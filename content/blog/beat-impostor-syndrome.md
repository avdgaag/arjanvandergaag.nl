Impostor Syndrome is the failure to internalize your own success. Impostors
commonly believe they have used luck and charm to trick the world into thinking
they're more competent than they actually are. I have found these to be dangerous
thoughts that lead to unnecessary suffering. Here's how to beat it.

## What is Impostor Syndrome?

[WikiPedia describes impostor syndrome][wikipedia] as follows:

> Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain
> convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have
> achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of
> deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than
> they believe themselves to be.

So, impostor syndrome is about how we attribute success in the world: when
other people are "successful", we attribute that to their qualities and we
discount the environmental factors; when we are successful, we discount our
own qualities and attribute it to the environment. _They_ are competent, _I_
just got lucky.

People with impostor syndrome can usually rationally explain their own
competence. We "know" we didn't get that raise last year for a job well done.
The brain has to synthesise the feelings of incompetence ("I have no idea what
I'm doing") with the evidence of success ("I got a good raise this year"). The
simplest conclusion it can come up with is: you're fake, and it's only a matter
of time before the rest of the world finds out.

## Why should I care?

Impostor syndrome can manifest itself in different forms, such as the fear of
being criticised, fear of failure, the fear of admitting you don't know or
reluctance to accept outside help (see Valerie Young's _The Secret Thoughts Of
Successful Women_ for much more in-depth review of this topic).

Such thoughts can lead to harmful behaviour,
such as self-sabotage, never finishing work, shying away from the spotlight,
and, most commonly, overcompensation. By putting in more time and effort than
anyone else, you try to cover up your supposed incompetence. This, of course,
only raises expectations and reinforces the feelings of inadequacy. Ultimately,
when not dealt with, impostor syndrome can lead to burn out, depression and
missed opportunities for joy and fulfillment — affecting not only impostors
personally but also their jobs and their loved ones.

Burn out is not the only negative effect to look out for. There is a number of
harmful effects impostor syndrome can have on your software team:

- **Reduced knowedge sharing** when impostors are afraid to ask questions
  (for fear of appearing incompetent) or neglect to share their views (assuming
  everybody already knows this).
- **Quality drops** when impostors are afraid to criticise each other works in
  code reviews or pair programming sessions, or put off collecting feedback on
  their work until the last possible moment before the deadline.
- **Shirking on responsibility** for a project out of fear of revealing supposed
  incompetence, hurts the self-guiding agile team and places a heavier burden on
  traditional project management.
- **Not showcasing good work** in the company, towards clients or at
  conferences. Taking credit can be hard for impostors who feel their work is
  not good enough or tend to deflect praise to others. Team members miss out on
  well-deserved pride and the company on potential new business.
- **A competitive disadvantage** compared to other companies who can innovate,
  experiment and try out new things without fear of appearing unprofessional or
  incompetent.

## Deal with your own impostor syndrome

Typical advice for dealing with impostor syndrome is to learn to accept yourself
and give yourself permission to fail. Those are lofty goals indeed, but here I
propose a few more actionable steps from my own experience your might take to
achieve them.

1.  **Name it**<br>
    Transforming a vague sense of inadequacy and unease into a specific,
    understandable syndrome is a pre-requisite for actually doing something
    about it.

2.  **Be mindful**<br>
    You don't have to believe every thought you have. Mindfulness
    can help you observe and accept thoughts and emotions as they come and go,
    without judgement. Rather than being defined by feelings of inadequacy, this
    allows you to respond to those feelings.

3.  **Write a personal mission statement**<br>
    We cannot trust our brains to assess
    our succes — it tells us we're impostors — so we need something else. A
    personal mission statement is a great way to create an external frame of
    reference for success against what matters most to you. Reflect on it
    regularly to remind yourself of what success actually means to you.

4.  **Gather a feedback group**<br>
    A group of trusted peers that give you feedback
    is another great way to get external validation of how you are doing. This
    is not about re-assurance, but honest feedback — as scary as that may be.

5.  **Step outside your comfort zone**<br>
    …because that's where interesting things
    happen. Understand the boundaries of your comfort zone, anticipate the
    thoughts and feelings that will come up when you will step outside it,
    and then make the conscious decision to make that step.

In summary: be aware of your emotions, create external references for competences
and then hold your breath and take that scary leap.

## Helping others with their impostor syndrome

Dealing with impostor syndrome on your own is one thing, but you may be able to
help others, too. Impostors will do their best to hide their true emotions from
you as a colleague
or team leader (after all, they don't want to be found out), but there are some
outward signs that you can look for. None of these necessarily indicate impostor
syndrome per se, but when you notice enough of them, you might want to open up
conversation:

- self-deprecating humour, downplaying achievements and emphasising mistakes or
  perceived failures;
- desperately slaving alone on a difficult problem without asking for help;
- reluctance toward pair programming, and consistently favouring the role of
  passive navigator;
- providing little input in code reviews or architecture discussions, preferring
  to follow others' lead;
- constantly referring to what is wrong in a project and being unable to
  celebrate success;
- spending lots of extra hours at home or at the office to shore up skills or
  solve problems few other people care about.
- preference to work alone and integrate their work with the rest of the team as
  little and as late as possible;
- writing good fixes in open source software and not submitting them back to the
  original project, or failing to extract useful libraries out of succesful
  projects;

Again, all these behaviours might have a myriad of valid or practical reasons.
But observe enough of them in smart and experienced developers and it might be
time for a chat. Regardless, there are ways to minimise the harmful effects of
impostor syndrome in the workplace:

- **Create a safe environment**<br>
  Safety is crucial in teams. Foster respect, openness and feedback in your
  teams, and ensure team members feel the permission to make mistakes.

- **Set explicit expectations**<br>
  If you are a manager, make sure your set clear boundaries and expectations for
  your teams. Explain what behaviour will get them rewarded and respected, how
  you're allowed to fail, and what the company values. Make no mistake, this all
  is a lot easier said than done.

- **Coaching**<br>
  Employ professional coaching for you team members. This means an experienced,
  preferably external, coach — not a manager taking 10 minutes to ask how
  you're doing. Coaching can quite effective, but only if you are not discussing
  your personal issues with someone in charge of your salary or contract.

Most of all, make sure competency, success and failure are transformed from fuzzy
notions into explicit values and boundaries. Make it explicit, demonstrate their
application and over time, team members will be able to internalise them. When
they do, they will flourish.
