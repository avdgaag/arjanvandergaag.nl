title: Using Postbox
---
I've decided to give [Postbox](http://postbox-inc.com) (version 1) a try as my default e-mail client. I love Mail.app's simplicity, but it has some quirks and I feel I could do better.

Here's what I like so far:

* A sleek interface for tagging (called _topics_)
* Quick browsing of attachments in a folder or from a contact
* Archive message immediately with ‘a’
* Gmail-style conversation view
* Pretty good and quick search
* Plug-in potential, although there's not much available yet.

Here's what I dislike so far:

* No global folders, i.e. one inbox, trash, sent and drafts for all accounts
* Topics don't seem to be IMAP-portable, so you have to apply tags both at home and at work
* Message rules can not filter on content, only on message headers
* The message composer is bulky
* Integration with Mac OS X is not as good as Mail.app
* It's Mozilla-based, not native.

I'm undecided on:

* Tabbed interface. I'm not used to it, I don't need it and I don't use it. But it might grow on me.
* Editing messages: not sure why I'd want to do that.
* Facebook and Twitter integration

Postbox does not come for free, while Mail.app and Thunderbird do. So it should really impress be before I switch. I remain unconvinced but hopeful for now.
