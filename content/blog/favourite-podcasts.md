My daily commute is way less sucky than it would be without podcasts. Here are
some of my current favourites.

## My Favourites

### Revolutions

[Mike Duncan's _Revolutions_][Revolutions] podcast is definitely my favourite.
That's hardly surprising, considering I've listened to his earlier _[History of
Rome][]_ from start to finish _at least_ four times. _Revolutions_ deals with
various political revolutions in history; so far it has covered the English
revolution, the American revolution and the French revolution. Duncan's writing
strikes a great balance between history, politics, humour and historical trivia
and clarity; his narration has become the standard against which I measure other
podcasts and audiobooks. If you're at all interested in history, I cannot
recommend Duncan's work enough.

### The Economist

[The Economist][] is a great newspaper to keep up with current affairs. It also
takes great advantage of modern media with a superb [audio edition][The
Economist audio] (the full contents of the weekly paper in audio form), [mobile
apps][The Economist apps] and [Twitter accounts][The Economist twitter]. It's
[nicepodcast feed][The Economist podcast] includes some full articles from the
audio edition, and some podcast-specific shows hosted by editors and
correspondents. Subscribe to The Economist for the audio edition, or get a good
summary from the free podcast.

### The Incomparable

_[The Incomparable][]_ is an awesomely geeky show full of nerds and geeks
discussing stuff nerds and geeks are into. Jason Snell and a host of panelists
discuss movies, comics, TV shows and books -- and they're not afraid to spend
over an hour talking about an 80 seconds-long Star Wars trailer. Listening to
_The Incomparable_ is probably as close as you can get to having a laugh with some
geeky friends on a friday night while you're on your monday-morning commute.

### The Infinite Monkey Cage

Take two witty hosts, a panel of scientists and comedians and let them discuss
grand topics in front of a live audience on BBC Radio 4 and you're set for
inpsired, educated laughs. The BBC's _[The Infinite Monkey Cage][]_ is a perfect
mix of science and British humour.

### In Our Time

BBC Radio 4's _[In Our Time][]_ is a weekly show about science, history,
philosophy, culture and art. Melvyn Bragg and three guests, usually leading
experts in a field, discuss topics raning from the life of Caesar to the nature
of prime numbers. There are new shows coming out every week, but there's also a
great archive of past episodes.

### Listen to Lucy

I recently started listening to Lucy Kellaway "poking fun at management fads and
jargon and celebrating the ups and downs of office life" in the _[Listen to
Lucy][]_ podcast from the [Financial Times][]. The episodes are witty and brief
and a nice change of pace from some of the other, denser topics in this list.
