# Projects

## [bol][] -- Ruby gem for the bol.com API

The bol gem is a wrapper around the bol.com developer API, allowing you to query their webshop for products and retrieve all sorts of product details and imagery, and list popular products by category. It integrates with their affiliate marketing program.

## [rpub][] -- Ruby gem for generating ebooks from plain text files

Rpub is a command-line tool you can use to generate a .epub (or .mobi) file from a set of simple plain text files, written in Markdown. It handles the ePub boilerplate files for you, as well as images, table of contents, layout and style. Rpub allows you to focus on the writing.

## [typogruby][] -- Ruby gem for improving web typography

Typogruby is a simple Ruby gem that provides a set of text filters to handle some of the more tedious tasks of web typography for you. It adds HTML markup to any piece of text to prevent widows, style ampersands, leading quotes, abbreviations and special characters.

## [rocks][] -- Sass mixins library for modular stylesheets

In order to keep stylesheets of non-trivial size maintainable, you need conventions and modularity, so you can stop worrying about the mundane and focus and what's special. Rocks is a little library of mixins for commonly used layouts and styles that can help DRY up your stylesheets.

* [Gista][] is a command-line Gist client and Ruby library.
